## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

 - I can ensure that my code is secure and functional by first starting with how the user will use the software and creating test cases around that usage. Then I would create tests around those test cases and verify edge cases. After the tests have been made, I can then start writing the software that the user will actually use.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

 - considering the user input options is the best place to start and then extrapolating that into how the data will be manipulated creates another layer of tests we can run. If that data manipulation happens between systems, then testing that data handoff is important. Walking through how the user will enter data and how that data will be manipulated, stored, and displayed are all important user need focused things to consider when developing tests.

## How do I approach designing software?

 - I design tests first for complex systems and then design the code to fit the tests. If we start with the code itself, we often cannot know when we have developed the right solution and do not know when we are done. If we start with the end in mind and design tests before the core logic, we often can get better, more secure, faster code; the quality of code and the improvements we get come from what we design our tests around. If we design tests to fail with certain edge cases, we are likely to push software that accounts for those edge cases. Test driven development helps us establish the measuring stick for us to judge our code. If I want my code to perform in a certain way, I first design the tests to ensure that my code meets that requirement or fails and has me refactor.
